### 1. Who collected the data?

_The data is collected by the Inside Airbnb project leader, Murray Cox [1], in order to know how Airbnb is being used in London._

---

### 2. Why did they collect it?

_They collected the data, because the data can explain simple and complex questions in any neighbourhoods [2]. For example, they can easily make better recommendations for accommodates to satisfy their requirements. Furthermore, they can also control the search results by ranking the host verifications, host review scores, and host acceptance rate, among others, in order to allocate accommodates to the right hosts._

---

### 3. How was it collected?

_First of all, some information was collected at the beginning, when the hosts registered and verified in Airbnb, such as their name and the types of verification. Secondly, when they post their properties, they need to upload some pictures, create property names, descriptions, locations, the number of bedrooms bathrooms, prices, and maximum and minimum nights, among others. Finally, after checking out, accommodates will leave a rating score, in terms of location, communication, value and cleanliness._

### 4. What useful information does it contain?


_There are some useful columns that the data contains [3]. Firstly, host information has been informed by host_since, host_response_time, host_response_rate, and verifications. Secondly, the locations of the properties have been stated by host_location, street, neighbourhood, latitude, and longitude, among others. Moreover, details of the properties could be explained by property_type, room_type, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the number of beds and their types, and amenities, among others. Furthermore, the price of the room per night, rental days in the last 30, 60, 90, and 365 days are given. Finally, rating scores have been specified in terms of accuracy, cleanliness, check in process, communication with hosts, location and value. By gathering this information, some analyses will be carried out, such as text analysis, statistical analysis, and predictive analysis, among others._

### 5. What useful information is it missing?

_However, some other information is missing. First of all, the rules of the property are not given, such as smoking area and whether pets are allowed to stay or not. The purposes of travelling should also state, and the surrounded markets should be mentioned. The deposit of the property and cleaning surcharge are missing out. Finally, the area and square feet of the room is not included, which is one of the most significant fields that accommodates care about._

---

### 6. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

_From the point of view, the data is partially complete. According to the previous two questions, some host information, location details, property type, number of rooms, and reviewing scores are stated clearly in the data. However, there are some columns missing, such as square feet of the property, deposit and cleaning fees, and travelling information, among others. Therefore, in the term of schema completeness [4], the data is partly complete. Furthermore, although the majority of the columns are completed with valid information. There are some missing values in some columns, such as response time, response rate, and acceptance rate. Therefore, in the term of column completeness [4], the data is also partially complete. To sum up, although some columns and values are missing, other aspects of analysis can also be applied. Therefore, the data is partially completed._

### 7. What kinds of analysis would this support?

_Based on the useful information the data contains, the data can support different kinds of analysis. First of all, text mining can be applied. Airbnb will be able improve predictive analytic models for customer attraction. For example, the most attractive amenities for accommodates will be carried out. Secondly, by applying historical data, statistical analysis can be made. For example, in the term of review scores, mean, standard deviation, and variance can be calculated, therefore, hosts which have been scored lower than mean can be considered as low performance. Predictive analysis can also be carried out, such as the predication on future host acceptance rate, and which location is going to have more orders. Finally, prescriptive analysis can also help Airbnb to make decisions based on current information and probabilities. For example, by combining prescriptive analysis and predictive analysis, Airbnb will be able to advise hosts some methods to generate more orders, such as increasing response rate and reducing deposit._

---

### 8. What kinds of analysis would it _not_ support?

_Some kinds of analysis will not be supported because the information is insufficient. Firstly, some text analysis cannot be used in the term of the rules for accommodates. For example, Airbnb may not know if pets are not permitted and the rooms are too small, how many orders will be lost. Secondly, without travelling information, predictive analysis cannot be applied, as Airbnb cannot forecast the types of the host that accommodates prefer, if they travel for work/leisure, which in turn, Airbnb may not be able to apply prescriptive analysis and make proper suggestions to hosts in order to attract customers travelling for different purposes._

### 9. Which of the uses presented in Q.7 and Q.8 are _ethical_?

_According to the data used in the previous analysis, ethical issues occur. Some recent study [5] has suggested that small number of variables per record can reveal people. In the data, it included some information more than an ID and rating, the variables also contain exact location, personal habit, availabilities, and pictures, among others. Therefore, the data might risk hostsâ€™ well-being [5] from variety ways. For example, personal information can be misused in scam. Stealing may also happen, because the address, neighbourhood, and availabilities, are clearly stated. The study [5] also indicated that the researcher, such as Murray Cox, must make the data secure, and keep them in private. In order to keep privacy, the researchers may not share the data with audiences. However, it may harm the research in the term of reproducible._
